# Nbsigmlift.com Product E-commerce Platform

## Goal
This project was developed for a client selling elevator products under the Fuji Elevator Japan brand. The client requested a completely custom-coded e-commerce platform, built from scratch using core programming languages only â€” with no use of external frameworks or CMS like WordPress or Laravel.

### Client Goals:
1. Create a responsive and user-friendly website to showcase elevator products.
2. Support both bulk orders (for corporate clients) and single purchases (for individuals).
3. Enable bank transaction options like wire transfer and LLC-based business deals instead of online payment gateways.
4. Provide a clear product inquiry and quote request process.

## My Role
- Developed the entire platform using core PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.
- Designed a fully responsive and user-friendly UI/UX tailored for both business and individual users.
- Implemented a custom admin panel for product management, order tracking, and client communication.
- Integrated a secure, step-by-step quote request system to support bank transfer workflows.
- Built custom logic for pricing based on quantity and customer type (B2B/B2C).

## Challenges
- No frameworks or libraries allowed, requiring full custom development.
- Complex business workflow for manual orders and banking transactions.
